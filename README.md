### Datasets
•	Senate Election Results – Web Scrapping http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/senate/
•	Credit Card Debt – Web Scrapping
https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-credit-card-debt
•	Bankruptcy by state - Web Scrapping -  https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/highest-personal-bankruptcy-rates-in-the-us-by-state.html
•	 Congress Bill Introduction Data on Student, Consumer, Medical Debt- CSV


### What useful investigation could be done with the final database

Senators want to know whether to campaign on or introduce legislation on consumer debt, student debt or medical debt.


### Justification for relational or nonrelational
We are going to build a non-relational database
-	No huge amount of data (500 rows)
-	Little to gain from normalization as we are looking at state-level data
