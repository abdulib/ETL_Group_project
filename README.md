### Datasets
*	[Senate Election Results](http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/senate/) – Web Scrapping

*	 Congress Bill Introduction Data on Student, Consumer, Medical Debt- CSV


### What useful investigation could be done with the final database

Senators want to know whether to campaign on or introduce legislation on consumer debt, student debt or medical debt.


### Justification for relational or nonrelational
We are going to build a non-relational database
*	No huge amount of data (500 rows)
*	Little to gain from normalization as we are looking at state-level data
